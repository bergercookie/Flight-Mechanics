    \begin{tabular}{p{7cm}|p{7cm}}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Pros}  & \textbf{Cons} \\
    \midrule
    (+) Very well structured report & (-) Better Title needed - Does not give enough information about the subject \\
    (+) Good coherence between the theoretical analysis of the problem at hand and with historical facts, practical implementation etc.  & (-) No contents - Should have been included \\
          & (-) Use different font/style for figure captions \tablefootnote{Different font/style is needed in order for the reader to understand where
          the main text and where the figure 'boundaries' are}\\
          & (-) References are not properly cited - Refer more to books rather than webpages \\
          & (-) References style - Do not use justified style \\
