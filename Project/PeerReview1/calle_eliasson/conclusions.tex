\section{Conclusions}% Table generated by Excel2LaTeX from sheet 'Sheet1'

Besides minor defects (caption style, refs style etc), the structure of the report was 
positive for this kind of technical report. However there were problems with the technical side of the report since
the optimization section was not analyzed adequately, the max altitude plot wasn't presented at all, and the monitoring plots (velocity, rem. fuel, 
control variable etc) were not properly exaplained.
