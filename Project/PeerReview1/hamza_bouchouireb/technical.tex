    \toprule
    \textbf{Pros}  & \textbf{Cons} \\ 
    \midrule
    (+) \textit{Very good introductory part}, including general characteristics of aircraft but getting more specific when needed & (-) No proper $\alpha_{max}$ curve in the TEX Graph \\
    (+) Thorough analysis of static performance, (maybe overanalyzing in the SEP Graph section) & (-) Captions of tables have to be as descriptive as the figures they correspond to \tablefootnote{i.e do not use first , second etc but prefere repeating the actual goal (h = 11km, M = 1.5 ..)} \\
    (+) Optimization Part: \textit{Actual goal is not stated in the introduction} & (-) "Some" more energy lines would have been useful to get the overall picture \\
    (+) Good coherence between the theoretical analysis of the problem at hand and with historical facts, practical implementation etc.  &  \\
    (+) Very analytical description of the mechanism of going supersonic &  \\
