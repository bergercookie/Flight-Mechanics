    \midrule
    (+)Figure (2) is quite expanatory & (-) What about the dynamic pressure limit? It should have been stated and plotted in the excess thrust graph since the graph include the negative values \\
    (+)Values for $C_{l\beta},C_{lp}$ seem quite reasonable & (-) Equation (2.5) should correspond to $\dot{\phi}$ instead of $\phi$ \\
          & (-) Procedure of calculating $C_{l\beta}$ is not given \\
          & (-) No mathematical proof whatsoever on why the specific equations are used \\
          & (-) Why does the $v-\xi$ curve increases goes up as the $\xi$ values increase? \\
