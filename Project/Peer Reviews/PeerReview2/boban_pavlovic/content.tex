          & (-) High frequency of syntax \\& vocabulary language mistakes \\
          & (-) \quad aircraft's motion $\rightarrow$ motion of the aircraft \\
          & (-) \quad (p.4 par.3) L is defined positive in a clockwise motion from the pilot/fuselage point of view \\
          & (-) \quad (Fig. 7) squar $\rightarrow$ squares \\
          & (-) SEP graph is cropped at 16 km altitude. The maximum altitude is actually higher by a small fraction \\
          & (-) State the goals for optimization in the actual SEP graph (where do we want the aircraft to reach) \\
          & (-) Only 1 optimization case is explained. What about the rest? \\
          & (-) More insight should have been given on the notion of the excess thrust and power. \\
          & (-) Rushed report especially in terms of form. \\
          & (-) Classical introduction "With the jet era starting â€¦" \\
          & (-) Tough for the reader to follow \\
