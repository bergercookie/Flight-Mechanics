    \textbf{Pros} & \textbf{Cons} \\
    \midrule
    (+) (Figure 2) Explanatory graph - Descriptive legend is also included & (-) (2nd paragraph of Performance Model analysis) The resulting forces on the airplane are equal to zero  only in the vertical axis. \\
    (+) (Table 1) Very descriptive table & (-) (Figure 2) No stall  lim is included in the graph \\
    (+) Data graphs (Fig 4,5) are correct  & (-) Figure 3 is totally wrong. The $\alpha$, qdyn limits are also not specified \\
    (+) Nice idea of comparing the derived Clp graph with the one extracted from the Draken database (fig. 6)  & (-) (Unsteady aerodynamic derivative) Procedure of deriving the analytical equation of $\phi$ is not explained \\
    (+) Formulas for calculating $C_{lp}, C_{l\beta}$ seem to be correct & (-) References are not properly cited - Refer more to books rather than webpages \\
          & (-) Matlab code implementation should not have been included \\
