    \toprule
    \textbf{Pros}  & \textbf{Cons} \\    \midrule
    (+) Well explained procedure towards final outcomes & (-) Stall limit in TEX Graph looks false. Maybe wrong interpolation method (order of polynomial used?)/ wrong data inserted  \\
    (+) Reasonable mathematical approach to the problem & (-) Maximum mach number is erached at 800s (13.3min), Afterburner use > 10min - should have found a faster approach \\
          & (-) Max altitude curve not shown at all, not  mentioned during the final part of review either. \\
          & (-) In both optimization tasks presented, final state is not shown (fuel remained, final velocity, etc) \\
          & (-) Figure 6d: For which case does it correspond to?  \\
          & (-) Figure 6d: Fuel seems to be totally depleted \\
