abstract.tex:3:This work deals with varius aspects of the \textit{J35 Draken aircraft} performace. More specifically the report is devided into three main
abstract.tex:5:problems (reaching maximum altitude, maximum Mach number, etc) so that the ideal trajectory to fly with is found
abstract.tex:6:In the second part the $C_{lp},\, C_{l\beta}$ constants are calculated after the processing of experimental data.
abstract.tex:10:The report is intended for the \textit{Flight Mechanics} course offered by the School of 
abstract.tex:12:technical computing language was used.
intro_reloaded.tex:8:to chose from were swept wings and delta wings \cite{dorr_aerofax_1987}.
intro_reloaded.tex:19:In general the double delta was found to offer the attributes of:
intro_reloaded.tex:39:such a sharp sweep, it was recognized that the plane would be seriously lacking

mathematical_modelling_1.tex:59:\noindent The angle of attack is obtained in each iteration of the numerical scheme
mathematical_modelling_1.tex:64:The relation between Excess thrust and Specific Excess Power is given by the following equation:
minimum_time.tex:11:The feasible solution to the above challenge is shown in \ref{fig:m15h11}. \ref{fig:m15h11_2}

rolling_momment_coef.tex:2:In this part of the project the rolling moment coefficient of the J35 Draken is to be calculated.
rolling_momment_coef.tex:3:For the simulation, the model of fig.\ref{fig:model} was used:
rolling_momment_coef.tex:15:The following can be stated when comparing the J35 Draken aircraft with the wind tunnel model used(fig.~\ref{fig:model})
rolling_momment_coef.tex:27:a valid mathematical model needs to be derived first.
