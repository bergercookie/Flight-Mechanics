\section{Static Perfomance}

\subsection{Excess Thrust}

Figure \ref{fig:Tex_Graph} shows the Excess Thrust with regards to the Mach number is presented:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \hspace*{-2cm}
    \includegraphics[width=1.2\textwidth]{Tex_Graph}
    \caption{Excess Thrust Graph}
    \label{fig:Tex_Graph}
\end{figure}

Using the graph we can now determine the envelope limits corresponding to the dynamic pressure and the 
maximum angle of attack. These limits are shown in the diagram as red and blue Xs.
We should note however that the dynamic pressure limits are not visible in  \ref{fig:Tex_Graph}, when presenting 
only the part of the diagram above the zero horizontal line, so a supplementary graph (\ref{fig:Tex_Graph2}) is given:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \hspace*{-2cm}
    \includegraphics[width=1.2\textwidth]{Tex_Graph2}
    \caption{Excess Thrust Graph - Dynamic pressure limits Visible}
    \label{fig:Tex_Graph2}
\end{figure}

\noindent For the calculation of the Excess Thrust the TexSep function was used. Refer to the TexSep.m module 
for more information on the implementation

\subsection{SEP Graph}

Using the code provided with the report the Specific Excess Power (SEP) Graph
can be plotted:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \hspace*{-2cm}
    \includegraphics[width=1.2\textwidth]{SEP_Graph}
    \caption{SEP Graph}
    \label{fig:SEP_Graph}
\end{figure}

Graph \ref{fig:SEP_Graph} shows the contours of same Excess Power with regards to
the altitude of the airplane as well as the Mach number thus the velocity of the airplane.

Using the graph we can also determine the envelope limits corresponding to the maximum angle of attack
$(15^{\degree})$ and the maximum dynamic pressure corresponding to $1350 \sfrac{km}{h}$ at sea level which 
is $8.6133e+04 Pa$.

\subsection{Maximum altitude - Maximum Mach Number}
The maximum altitude and the maximum Mach Number at which the aircraft can fly level 
can be determined using \ref{fig:SEP_Graph}:

\begin{itemize*}
    \item Max. Altitude: 16 km
    \item Max Mach: 1.76
\end{itemize*}
