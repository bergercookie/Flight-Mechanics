This work deals with varius aspects of the \textit{J35 Draken aircraft} performace. More specifically the report is devided into three main
sections. In the first section we derive the excess thrust and envelope graphs and we also simulate for three optimization 
problems (reaching maximum altitude, maximum Mach number, etc) so that the ideal trajectory to fly with is found
In the second part the $C_{lp},\, C_{l\beta}$ constants are calculated after the processing of experimental data.
In the final part, we deal with various stability and control aspects of the aircraft as well as simulating 
the execution of a looping maneuver

The report is intended for the \textit{Flight Mechanics} course offered by the School of 
Engineering Sciences in KTH. For the executed simulations, the \textit{MATLAB}
technical computing language was used.
